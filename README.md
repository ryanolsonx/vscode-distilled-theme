# No Syntax Highlighting for Visual Studio Code

A collection of themes that give little to no syntax highlighting.

## Free Solo

Inspired by Alex in Free Solo. This is a Visual Studio Code theme that's a lot like free soloing. A bit dangerous, not a lot of gear. Just you and the "wall".

Syntax highlighting distilled down to reveal what's important. Comments are highlighted.
